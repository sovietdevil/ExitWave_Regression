# ExitWave_Regression
Regression on atomic exit wave of HRTEM based on Gaussian parameterization.

The following models or simulation results are compared.

1. Tempas results
2. abTEM results
3. Gaussian model results
4. Channeling model results
5. PWPOA model results
6. Factor correction

Which focuses on the following cases, including 2D materials:
1. Graphene
2. $\text{MoS}_2$

and crystals:
1. Gold column
2. Germanium column
3. Aluminum column doped with silver

With variables of:
- Thickness
- Defocus
- Sample tilt
