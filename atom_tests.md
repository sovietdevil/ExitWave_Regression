## Atom tests
To test the performance of the parameterization, each atom is taken into tests, investigating the exit wave of each atom within certain propagagtion distances.

The preparation steps includes the followings:

1. Generation of structure files
2. Programs for multislice calculations
3. Strategies to analyze the output files

#### Generation of the structure files
This generates files in `.at` format for MacTampas, and in `.cif` for Dr. Probe and abTEM. One atom locates in the center.
